Here's a list of data we use for the functioning of the bot
* Roles/Members and other server related stuff saved in the bot cache for it to function

### ✨ DATA WE STORE
We store minimal amount of data from you , which includes 
* IDs of the server who use custom prefixes and custom embed colors 
* ID of channels where the welcome message needs to send messages upon a user joining
* ID of a user who requested a feature or made a bug report 
   > All of the above mentions are only cases of user consent , they get saved only after a user makes the bot do that



### ✨ WHO CAN ACCESS THIS DATA?
**Cache** : The cache data is saved within the bot's script and no-where locally , it completely non-
accessible  to anyone other than the bot

**Stored Data** : This data is stored locally in an encrypted database which can only be opened after downloading the database file ( only available to the application owner ),



### ✨ HOW CAN WE MAKE SURE THAT THE DATA IS SECURED ?
Application is hosted on a dedicated VPS with complete security . 
The bot is fully open sourced , just to keep a transparency between the developer and the users !
